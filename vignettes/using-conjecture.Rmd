`conjecture()` is the black swan of the `sift` family. While sift, break_join and kluster are all intended for everyday household use, conjecture is an extremely powerful hammer designed for a specific nail.

At its heart, conjecture is a reshaping operation similar to `tidyr::pivot_wider()`. However, the intended application for conjecture is more idiosyncratic than that of pivot_wider. This vignette illustrates the basic aspects of such an application.
