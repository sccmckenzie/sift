* On a highway, moving vehicles tend to coalesce into clusters[^2]. **`sift::kluster`** automatically identifies these natural groupings.

* One would expect to identify many vehicles with one timestamp in each direction (e.g. commuting to work). **`sift::spy`** provides visibility to this conjectural aspect of our dataset.

* What if we wanted to analyze how traffic density changes with Express lane prices? This would require inexact joining with another time-series dataset toll prices. **`sift::interlace`** performs this task in one step.

* Finally, we can use **`sift::sift`** to access chunks of rows surrounding points of interest.
