`conjecture()` is the black swan of the `sift` family. If you encounter the type of eccentric datasets  conjecture is designed to tackle, you'll be glad you read this vignette. 

At its heart, conjecture is a reshaping operation similar to `tidyr::pivot_wider()`. However, the intended application for conjecture is more idiosyncratic than that of pivot_wider. This vignette illustrates the basic aspects of such an application.

## Example 1: Radio Transmissions

The `comms` dataset contains a time-series of radio transmissions.

```{r}
library(sift)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

comms
```

A few notes:

* We are **not interested** in the interaction between the stations. Each station (A, B, C, D) can be regarded as 4 independent time-series. 
* The subject of each transmission is denoted by `msg_code`.
* Each `msg_code` can be repeated multiple times (see below).
* There is **no guarantee** that a *sent* transmission will be met with a  *response* sharing the same `msg_code`.

```{r}
comms %>% 
  filter(station == "C",
         msg_code == 3060)
```

Suppose we wish to restructure `comms` so that the "natural" pairing of `send` + `receive` transmissions is more apparent. Since there is no explicit information linking these rows together, we "conjecture" that, for a given `send` transmission (anterior), the corresponding `receive` transmission (posterior) is the closest observation measured by `timestamp`.

`conjecture()` always takes **4** arguments.

1. Dataset to reshape (`comms`).
2. Column, as a symbol, used to measure distance between observations (`timestamp`).
3. Column, as a symbol, that demarks observations as anterior or posterior (`type`).
4. Scalar quantity signifying anterior observation (`"send"`).

```{r}
comms_conjecture <- conjecture(comms,     # dataset to reshape.
                               timestamp, # <dttm> friendly. must be coercible to numeric.
                               type,      # any type of atomic vector is fine.
                               "send")    # we could flip our logic and supply "receive" instead.

comms_conjecture
```

We can partially achieve the same result with pivot_wider.

```{r}
comms_pivot <- comms %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = type,
              values_from = timestamp,
              values_fn = first) %>% 
  filter(receive > send)

comms_pivot
```

Notice that pivot_wider produces `r nrow(comms_pivot)` rows compared to `r nrow(comms_conjecture)` in `comms_conjecture`. What pairs are found in `comms_conjecture` that aren't captured in `comms_pivot`?

**First**, there a quite a few transmissions that do not elicit a response. conjecture doesn't sweep these under the rug.

```{r}
comms_pivot %>% 
  filter(is.na(receive))

comms_conjecture %>% 
  filter(is.na(receive))
```

**Second**, our call to pivot_wider only returned the "first viable pairs" within each combination of `station` + `msg_code`. On the other hand, `comms_conjecture` contains 3 (4 including missing value) viable pairs for the below combination.

```{r}
comms_pivot %>% 
  filter(station == "A",
         msg_code == 221)

comms_conjecture %>% 
  filter(station == "A",
         msg_code == 221)
```

The inclusion of multiple pairs for a given `station` + `msg_code` combination is the touchstone of conjecture.

### Underlying Logic

We'll use a small fragment from `comms` to illustrate how conjecture works.

```{r}
comms_small <- comms %>% 
  filter(station == "A",
         msg_code == 221)

comms_small
```

We can readily identify the send/receive pairs from the above observations. But how does conjecture accomplish this programmatically?

1. timestamps (specified by `sort_by = timestamps`) are separated into two vectors (specified by `names_from = type`).

```{r}
send <- comms_small %>% filter(type == "send") %>% pull(timestamp) %>% sort()
send

receive <- comms_small %>% filter(type == "receive") %>% pull(timestamp) %>% sort()
receive
```
2. Iterate through each element in `send`, with a nested loop for each element in `receive`. We can invert this hierarchy by setting `names_first = "receive"` instead.

```{r}
output <- integer(length = length(send))

for (i in seq_along(send)) {
  output[i] <- NA_integer_
  
  for (j in seq_along(receive)) {
    if (is.na(receive[j])) {
      next
    } else if (receive[j] > send[i]) {
      output[i] <- j
      break
    } else {
      next
    }
  }
}

tibble(send, receive = receive[output])
```
Conceptually, the above process flow is an accurate depiction of conjecture - though the underlying structure is more robust:

* conjecture reconciles the presence of additional columns, similar to conventional reshaping operations.
* conjecture relies on C++ to execute the looping structure.

### Duplicate Posterior Values

There is an important consequence associated with the above logic. We'll demonstrate by removing all but **one** of the `receive` elements from `comms_small`.

```{r}
# from comms small
receive <- receive[3]

# rerun the algorithm
for (i in seq_along(send)) {
  output[i] <- NA_integer_
  
  for (j in seq_along(receive)) {
    if (is.na(receive[j])) {
      next
    } else if (receive[j] > send[i]) {
      output[i] <- j
      break
    } else {
      next
    }
  }
}

tibble(send, receive = receive[output])
```
Why does `1999-02-21 12:29:59` appear 3 times? Recall:

"for a given `send` transmission (anterior), the corresponding `receive` transmission (posterior) is the closest observation measured by `timestamp`."

The above result is in accordance with this statement. However, at some point in the future, I may add the ability to drop repeat occurrences of posterior timestamps, which would produce the following result instead.

```{r echo = FALSE}
tibble(send, receive = receive[c(1, NA, NA, NA)])
```

## Example 2: Toll Lane Records

The `express` dataset contains toll records for **northbound** and **southbound** vehicles over the course of one business day.

```{r}
library(readr)

express <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sccmckenzie/mopac/master/inst/extdata/express.csv", locale = locale(tz = "US/Central"))

express
```

Suppose we are interested in vehicles using the express lane both `North` and `South` (i.e. commuting to work). It's up to us to designate an anterior `direction`. If we are only interested in vehicles commuting downtown, we set `names_first = "South"`.

```{r}
conjecture(express, time, direction, "South") %>% 
  drop_na() # We can't assume incomplete pairs are commuting to downtown
```

```{r fig.keep='none'}
library(ggplot2)

conjecture(express, time, direction, "South") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(trip_length = difftime(North, South, units = "hours")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(trip_length)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=4}
library(ggplot2)

conjecture(express, time, direction, "South") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(trip_length = difftime(North, South, units = "hours")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(trip_length)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        plot.title.position = "plot") +
  labs(title = "Trip length distribution",
       subtitle = "Vehicles commuting downtown",
       x = "Round trip length [hours]",
       y = NULL)
```
