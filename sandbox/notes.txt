## Sampling Assumptions

# All cars recorded in sample period do not pass through camera twice
# Cars in express lane omitted
# Recording north/south of 2222 has no effect on traffic desnity/distribution



# notes

# it might be nice to join this data with vehicles.csv dataset to calculate emissions etc.
# Check gap between observations 5 & 6 on Tuesday, suspect I wasn't shooting
# same cars since samples are taken from same time?
# in virtual dataset, when will it be decided to recycle specific vehicles?
# add slight noise to each timestamp (it's not possible for cars to travel through toll lane at exact same point in time)
