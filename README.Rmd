sift facilitates **intelligent** & **efficient** exploration of datasets.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sccmckenzie/sift")
```

sift is designed to work seamlessly with tidyverse.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # needed for below examples
library(sift)
```

### 1. `sift::sift()`
##### Imagine `dplyr::filter()` that includes neighboring observations.

Perhaps you remember the Utah monolith. The buzz surrounding its discovery (and disappearance) served as a welcome diversion from the otherwise upsetting twists and turns of 2020.

Suppose we are asked: *what else was happening in the world around this time?*

Let's peruse the `nyt2020` dataset to refresh our memory.

```{r}
nyt2020 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(headline, "Monolith")) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

The monolith story broke on 2020-11-24. Prior to writing this documentation, I certainly would not have remembered this happening in November specifically.

Let's take a peek at other headlines from ±2 days.

```{r}
nyt2020 %>% 
  filter(pub_date > "2020-11-22",
         pub_date < "2020-11-26") %>% 
  select(headline, pub_date)
```

Notice that it took **two steps** to achieve the above result. We first had to **find the date of the monolith story** then **perform a subsequent call to `filter()`**. This procedure would quickly become a nuisance after a few iterations.

`sift()` provides an interface to perform this exact process in **one step**.

```{r}
nyt2020 %>% 
  sift(pub_date, scope = 2, str_detect(headline, "Monolith")) %>% 
  select(headline, pub_date)
```

Under the hood, `sift()` passes `str_detect(headline, "Monolith")` to `dplyr::filter()`, then augments the filtered observations to include any rows falling in ±2 day window (specified by `pub_date` and `scope = 2`).

### 2. `sift::break_join()`
##### Harness combined power of `dplyr::left_join()` & `findInterval()`.

Take a look at the structure of `us_uk_pop` and `us_uk_leaders` below. How would you join these two datasets together? Specifically, we want each row in `us_uk_pop` to contain information (`name`, `party`) for the leader *at that time*.

```{r}
us_uk_pop %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 3)

us_uk_leaders
```

If you look closely at the dates in `us_uk_pop`, they typically fall around January 20th (US inauguration day). Joining by `country` & `year(date/start)` would sweep this inconvenient detail under the rug.

For one country alone, we could use `findInterval`.

```{r}
us_uk_pop %>% 
  filter(country == "USA") %>% 
  mutate(name = filter(us_uk_leaders, country == "USA")$name[findInterval(date, filter(us_uk_leaders, country == "USA")$start)])
```

The above code is somewhat unintelligible. Additionally, there is no straightforward way to accommodate `UK` & `USA` rows.

`break_join()` provides a simple interface leveraging functionality of `dplyr::left_join()` and `findInterval()`.

```{r}
break_join(us_uk_pop, us_uk_leaders, brk = c("date" = "start"))
```

Notice that `country` was detected as a common variable (courtesy of `dplyr::left_join()`). 

Alternatively, we could have supplied `by` explicitly.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# effectively the same as above call
break_join(us_uk_pop, us_uk_leaders, brk = c("date" = "start"), by = "country")
```

Additional arguments supplied to `...` will be automatically directed to `dplyr::left_join()` and `findInterval()`.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
a <- tibble(x = 1:5, y = runif(5, 4, 6))
b <- tibble(y = c(4, 5), z = c("A", "B"))

break_join(a, b, brk = "y")

break_join(a, b, brk = "y", all.inside = TRUE)
```

### 3. `sift::kluster()`
##### Imagine 1D K-means, except K is chosen automatically.

Consider the `faithful` dataset.

Density plot below clearly demonstrates there are **2** clusters of eruptions.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height=2}
ggplot(faithful, aes(eruptions)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_rug() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Currently, these clusters are *implicit*, meaning we do not have a categorical variable associating each observation with a cluster. We could manually assign clusters by drawing a line at, say, 3.0.

`kluster()` does this automatically - no extra inputs needed.

```{r}
k <- kluster(faithful$eruptions)
```


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height=2}
faithful$k <- k

ggplot(faithful, aes(eruptions)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_rug(aes(color = factor(k))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "k")
```
