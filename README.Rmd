# sift

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

sift facilitates **intelligent** & **efficient** exploration of datasets.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sccmckenzie/sift")
```

3 functions are provided:

* `sift` -  *augmented* dataset subsetting. Imagine `dplyr::filter()` that includes neighboring observations.

* `klassify` - reveal implicit grouping in continuous data.  Imagine 1D KNN - except you don't have to provide K.

* `kollate`


## klassify

```{r}
library(sift)

x <- c(1, 2, 2, 5, 3000)
```
By value, a natural split for `x` would be:

* **Group 1**: 1, 2, 2, 5
* **Group 2**: 3000

`klassify` does this automatically

```{r}
klassify(x)
```
